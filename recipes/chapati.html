    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the flour into a basin and add the salt and sugar to the flour.</li>
            <li> Now add the grated carrots to the flour followed by 3tablespoon of cooking oil. Mix the ingredients and flour well.</li>

            <li>Now add the water to the flour and start kneading until all the water has been absorbed and the the mixture is tough but not sticky.</li>
            <li>It should also not flow and be watery if it is add a bit of flour so that when rolling it doesn't become sticky but if it has extra flour add small amounts of water until all the powder absorbs the water.</li>
            <li> Allow it to rest for 20minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll the kneaded flour on a smooth surface then roll it out using a rolling pin.</li>
            <li>After completely stretching it out divide it into several 8 straight pieces.</li>
            <li>Use a sharp knife to cut the kneaded flour horizontal into several different pieces.</li>
            <li>For each piece roll the piece clockwise and then firmly press the rolled piece together to form a ball like the one shown on the side.</li>
            <li>Start roll out each ball into round flat pieces using the rolling pin.(don't worry if it's not very round the first time).</li>
            <li>Start by warming a flat pan on your oven.</li>
            <li> After it's warm place one of the pieces of chapati on the pan and apply oil on both sides until it turns brown then place the other side and apply oil on the side so that the oil goes down to the side that is not brown yet. </li>
            <li>Do this for all the chapati and the end result will be chapati looking like the ones folded on the side.</li>
