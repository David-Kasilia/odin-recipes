#  The Odin Project Using Html: A Recipes Website
## Project Overview
This is a website purely built using HTML only. 
This website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
i have used the following HTML elements to Develop this website:
1. I have used Git to push my project to Github. 
2. I have used Github to create a repository to save my project.
3. I have used the paragraph element <p> to create paragraphs to display blocks of sentences.
4. I have used headings to show different hierarchy to the content.
5. I have used the strong element <strong> to make text bold and marking the text important concerning the dish being prepared.
6. I have used a relative link to create a connection within own websites i.e the homepage and the other recipes
7. I have used images to display an image media in the website to give it a more richer look.
8. I have used lists both ordered and unordered lists to give Ingredients and Steps In the website.
9. I created the HTML boilerplate.
